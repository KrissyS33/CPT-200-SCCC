PROJECT NAME: YouAnalytics

DESCRIPTION: As a YouTuber, a web-based application that will allow you to quickly retrieve analytic information on your YouTube channel as well as videos can help you increase your viewers and subscribers across the globe. By having this information, you can optimize your channel and gain more traffic. Let me introduce to you, YouAnalytics.

Many YouTube content creators are left wondering about the impact that their content leaves on viewers. How many people watch their videos? For how long do those viewers stay engaged with the content? What about direct personal feedback in the form of likes, dislikes, or comments? YouAnalytics will provide a way to access that information through a convenient and simple user interface. Using the power of YouTube Analytics API, users will be provided all the data they need to gain insight into their content. This application will be a handy tool for anyone who seeks to demystify the environment of online content creation.
